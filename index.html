            <h4>Salt Lake Temple</h4>
            <p>
                The Salt Lake Temple is one of the most recognizable of all the temples of the Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter Days Saints. It took 40 years to build and was dedicated in 1893. It is located
                in Salt Lake City Utah near the headquarters of the Church. It is also the largest temple per 
                floor area. People visit the grounds of the Salt Lake Temple even if they do not enter. The grounds
                are especially busy during the Christmas holiday season because of the Christmas lights that are 
                displayed in great number.
